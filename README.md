Algorithms for recommender systems.

## TODO list:

* item cf
    *  different similarity measure

* user cf
    *  user-user similarity
    *  topic constrained user cf
    *  how to recommend users to users

* random walk
    *  transition matrix

* factorization machines
    *  svd
    *  svd++

* keyword/topic based methods
    *  combination of keywords, like N-gram of words
    *  bayesian inference of p(topic|user) and topic popularity

* SNS based methods

    *  friend cf (like user cf)
    *  recommend users based on friendship and click data

* blending and ensemble methods

    *  merge result lists from different algorithms
    *  merge items from keyword/topic that user followed or clicked.
